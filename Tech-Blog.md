After finishing my previous project ahead of schedule, I was ahead of pace in my Front End JavaScript course so I decided to do what Bloc refers to as a Capstone Project. This is a project of the student's choosing that will show off their skills as a developer.

Not knowing how hard it would be but seeing how it would benefit students in an online learning situation, I chose to create an app to allow both student and and teacher to code together. At http://www.pairprogrammingapp.com/ they can do exactly that. 

The app currently utilizes NodeJS as the server, Bootstrap with a Bootswatch theme to make it visually appealing, WS to create the WebSocket connection necessary to make it a viable pair programming app, MongoDB as the database, and MongooseJS to interface with MongoDB.
While it's still in the MVP stage, it is functional. The app is currently missing some features that I believe are necessary for it to be truly great so I'll be adding them as I have spare time, which may or may not be while I'm still in school. Time will certainly tell.
