After finishing my previous project ahead of schedule, I was ahead of pace in my Front End JavaScript course so I decided to do what Bloc refers to as a Capstone Project. This is a project of the student's choosing that will show off their skills as a developer.

Not knowing how hard it would be but seeing how it would benefit students in an online learning situation, I chose to create an app to allow both student and and teacher to code together. At http://www.pairprogrammingapp.com/ they can do exactly that.

The app currently utilizes <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> as the server, <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> with a <a target="_blank" href="https://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> theme to make it visually appealing, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/websockets/ws">WS</a> to create the WebSocket connection necessary to make it a viable pair programming app, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> as the database, and <a target="_blank" href="http://mongoosejs.com/">MongooseJS</a> to interface with MongoDB.

While it's still in the MVP stage, it is functional. The app is currently missing some features that I believe are necessary for it to be truly great so I'll be adding them as I have spare time, which may or may not be while I'm still in school.
