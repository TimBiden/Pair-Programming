After finishing my previous project ahead of schedule, I was ahead of pace in my Front End JavaScript course so I decided to do what Bloc refers to as a Capstone Project. This is a project of the student's choosing that will show off their skills as a developer.

Not knowing how hard it would be but seeing how it would benefit students in an online learning situation, I chose to create an app to allow both student and and teacher to code together. At my <a href="http://www.pairprogrammingapp.com/">Pair Programming App</a> they can do exactly that.

The app, when I wrote this blog post, utilizes a few different technologies but in most cases, I didn't take the easy route. My Bloc mentor wanted me to learn as much about JavaScript and its general environment as possible. So that's what I did. That includes using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NodeJS</a> as the server. My mentor wanted me to avoid using Express so that I could learn more about how a server works. Node still does a lot of the heavy lifting in creating a server but it doesn't include as many features as Express so I had to code some of those, such as redirecting to the new session URl, myself.

Because I'm admittedly not as artistic as I'd like to be, the appearance was created using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap</a> with a <a href="https://bootswatch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootswatch</a> theme. Bootstrap and the theme did most of the hard work but to make it look closer to the way I wanted it, I had to modify the theme's CSS file a bit. It also utilizes a generic CSS file I created to format the text editor.

The text editor box was created using HTML's textarea so I couldn't just implement a tool like HighlightJS or PrismJS. My mentor originally recommended that I use the contenteditable feature in HTML but I chose not to. In retrospect, that caused me a lot more work and I still have more work to do down the road but I was able to make it work on my own.

The WebSocket connection necessary to make it a viable pair programming app uses <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WS</a>. It creates and verifies the connection so data can be sent almost instantaneously when someone types in the box without needing to create a new connection or send a new header with every edit.

Because the MEAN stack is relatively popular right now, I chose to go with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MongoDB</a> as the database, and <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MongooseJS</a> to interface with MongoDB.
