#Pair Programming#

This is going to become an online text editor that 2 people can use at once to code on. It is designed to make learning programming easier for myself and other students as well as making teaching easier for mentors.

Screen sharing really isn’t pair programming. It’s show and tell because only 1 person can work on the code at a time. They’re designed to show what 1 person is doing on their screen, not true sharing.

With this app, both people will be able to code and see what the other person is typing as well as highlighting.

It's gonna rock! Eventually. Right now I'm just in creation and MVP mode.
