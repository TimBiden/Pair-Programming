# Pair Programming #

I'm a creating pair programming app for school because screen sharing isn't pair programming, it's show and tell.

Work in progress.

## Need to add: ##
- Create useable text editor. ✅
- Set up WebSocket server. ✅
- Connect to WebSocket server from the application. ✅
- Scope session to unique key from URL.
- Set up database to track changes
- Generate unique URL and store in database.
