#Pair Programming#

##The 5 Why's##
What I want to make:
	A pair-programming app.

###Why?###
* I want an online text editor that 2 people can use at once to code on.

###Why?###
* To make learning at Bloc easier for myself and other students.

###Why?###
* Because screen sharing really isn’t pair programming. It’s show and tell.

###Why?###
* Because only 1 person can work on the code at a time.

###Why?###
* Because they’re designed to show what 1 person is doing on their screen, not true sharing.

#Features:#

##MVP Features:##
* One person invites other to pair program.
* Invite should be a link to be easily shareable.
* Copy text into editor from clipboard.
* Show line numbers.
* Both people in app can see/make changes/highlights in real time.
* Link to copy current version to clipboard so you can paste it into standard editor.

##Advanced features:##
* Audio chat while in session.
* Load files from public GitHub repo.
* Select branch to work from.
* GitHub login to access private repos.
* Open any file in repo.
* Open in current state of specified file in given branch.
* When completed, commit changes to same branch.
* Users can create accounts and are given a unique URL.
* They can give that URL to someone else and when both use it, they’re in session together.

#Additional thoughts:#
* Maybe I could bring in a UI/UX student to help with it and make it usable.
