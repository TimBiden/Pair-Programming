# Pair Programming #

I'm a creating pair programming app for school because screen sharing isn't pair programming, it's show and tell.

Work in progress.

## Need to add: ##
- Set up WebSocket server.
  - After you get the Server example going, test it by hitting http://localhost:8080/ from different tabs (try on incognito). ✅
  - Construct a new page with a simple form to send messages to WS server via AJAX. ✅
  - Add broadcast functionality. ✅
  - Test keyup functionality.
- Connect to WebSocket server from the application.
- Generate unique URL and store in database.
- Scope session to unique key from URL.
